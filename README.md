matrizenrechner
===============

Online tool to calculate "easy" matrix operations for studying, checking, ... 

During my freshman year of college, I had to do so many matrix multiplications by hand, that it was easier to script it. There wasn't any really versatile tool, so I wrote this. 

After some time, this small project became bigger than expected. In the last few years it had more than 250000 views. 


--> Please note: 
Do not use this code for code reviews. I wrote this, while I was basically learning to program, never intended for it to become this big and neither intended to publish its code. I did not use any std containers, libraries, object-orientation and sometimes not even common sense. The html part is even worse.
